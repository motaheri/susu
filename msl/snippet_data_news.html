			<h5>Ladies hold their nerve at&nbsp;semifinals</h5>
			<p class="msl_pubdate">Tue 26 Feb 2013</p>

			<p class="leader">The ladies beat Southampton Solent to make the Cup Final 2013.</p>
             
            

			<div id="ctl00_ctl17_rptNews_ctl01_pnlArticleText" class="msl_newsbodytext">
	<p>
	Bright and early on Sunday morning the ladies' volleyball team left Swansea and headed to Southampton to take on Southampton Solent in the Western Conference Cup semifinal.</p>
<p>
	Being the only team that Swansea has lost to this season, there were mixed feelings about having to take them on again; On the one hand fearing they might lose and miss out on the Cup final, on the other hand hoping to revenge themselves for the close loss in December.</p>
<p>
	The game started promisingly, a few well-placed short balls quickly giving them a 5:1 headstart. This lead was soon extended to 6 points and could be held for most of the set, thanks to the team's very concentrated &amp; structured play. Only at the end did Southampton Solent catch up a little, but the set finally went to Seansea 25:22.</p>
<p>
	In their previous performance against Southampton Solent they had started similarly, winning the 1st set, but then they had got off to a bad start in the 2nd and 3rd resulting in the match being lost.</p>
<p>
	So the team was determind not to repeat this mistake and started well this time. Neither team could get any significant advantage over the other at first - both level at 9:9. Then Swansea turned up a gear and started to pull away. From 14:10 to 18:10, the victory seemed certain. But Southampton Solent were not going to give up without a fight and came back strongly to draw level at 23:23.</p>
<p>
	At the crucial moment Swansea managed to regain their composure, showig nerves of steel to win the next two points and claiming their place in the cup final on 13th March.</p>

<p>
 Got a room you need to fill in your house? Maybe you’re looking for housemates to buddy up with to go looking for a new place, or you’re looking for a room for next year.</p>
<p>
 The SU Housemate Service can help!</p>
<p>
 Advertise yourself or a room on a dedicated space on campus – the board opposite the Advice and Support Centre, ground floor of Fulton House.</p>
<p>
 It’s the <strong>only official place</strong> for students to advertise to other students – so no dodgy adverts from bad landlords!</p>
<p>
 SU Welfare Officer Charlotte said "For whatever reason, you might not have filled a house, or you might be looking to live with different people this year. It's really important to live with people you're sure you'll get on with, otherwise it can be a stressful time. We've introduced this service so you can advertise yourselves or a room somewhere where you know it won't get ripped down. It's a service by students for students!"</p>
<p>
 To advertise, hand in your completed A5 advert to the Advice and Support Centre, behind Costcutters by the stairs. </p>
<p>
 Alternatively, you can also use<strong><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/336846219717818/"> this facebook group.</a></strong></p>
<p>
 Don't forget to check out SAS Lettings, the union and university run Lettings Agent, on the Ground Floor of Fulton House by the Lloyds TSB Cashpoints. <a href="http://www.swansea.ac.uk/accommodation/saslettings/information%20for%20students/"><strong>You can also check out all their available properties online!</strong></a></p>
<p>
  </p>
<p>
 NB: Advert guide:-</p>
<p>
 All adverts (online or paper) <strong>must</strong> have a student email as the primary contact – this is how we can go some way to ensure it’s a service for students by students, and not a dodgy landlord or agent!</p>
<p>
 All paper adverts must be A5 or smaller so we can fit more in. </p>
<p>
 If you're looking for a house/room/roomates, feel free to talk a bit about your personality and what you're looking for. </p>

 The Students’ Union is seeking to help students find part-time work and develop new skills through a brand new part-time jobs fayre in October.</p>
<p>
 The fayre will feature a variety of employers, from both the Students’ Union and local businesses, offering students an excellent opportunity to speak to employers face to face and find out more about employment at university.</p>
<p>
 Alongside external and internal employers, the fayre will also host a variety of workshops and talks on subjects such as interview skills, what to wear for interviews and assistance with writing CVs and personal specifications. Employability Champions from each college at Swansea University will also be giving talks on the day telling students about opportunities in their own academic area.</p>
<p>
 Judith James, Strategic Projects Manager at the university welcomes the event saying “As manager of Swansea Employability Academy I am delighted that the students are leading this initiative and will fully support the event.</p>
<p>
 “Working or volunteering can help students to develop commercial and business awareness which is in demand by employers in every sector. There are opportunities to develop creativity, innovation and entrepreneurial skills- and you could earn some useful money as well!”</p>
<p>
 Information will be available regarding voluntary opportunities in the Students’ Union, from getting involved in campaigns, to working with the community or as a part-time officer or Subject and College Reps.</p>
<p>
 The fayre will be held on the 2<sup>nd</sup> October in the marquee soon to be erected in the front of Fulton House. It’s an event not just for first years but for all students looking to find part-time work, to gain new skills or to get involved with what the Students’ Union can offer.

 The National Assembly for Wales’ Finance Committee is currently conducting an inquiry into full time Higher Education funding.</p>
<p>
 This inquiry is looking at the financial considerations students take into account when deciding whether to go to university and what impact the Welsh Government’s tuition fee grant has on an individual’s choice. The purpose of this inquiry is to look at whether the Welsh Government is delivering value for money in this area.</p>
<p>
 The Committee would like to hear the views of first and second-year Welsh undergraduates who are studying in English or Welsh Higher Education Institutions, by completing a short questionnaire.</p>

	<p>
 The Students’ Union has been investigating why students will receive their loans and grants one week after the start of the final term.</p>
<p>
 <strong>In a response to the Education Officer, Mr Raymond Ciborowski, Registrar and Chief Operating Officer said:</strong></p>
<p>
 In a departure from the practice in previous years, the SLC required information from the University on the term dates applicable for AY 12/13 in November 2011 (rather than in early 2012).</p>
<p>
 The date that was supplied to the SLC for the start of the Summer Term was 22/04/13. It was understood that this date had been formally confirmed.</p>
<p>
 In January, however, the Summer Term start date for 2012 was finally set as 15/04/13.</p>
<p>
 The University did not inform the SLC of this discrepancy in the dates.</p>
<p>
 Students were informed individually by the SLC at the start of the academic year that the payment date for loans/grants for the Summer Term would be 22/04/13.</p>
<p>
 In March the University became aware of the discrepancy between the payment date and the start of term date and emailed all affected students before the Easter Vacation alerting them to the payment date of 22/04/13, and making students aware of how to access Money Advice if they were going to experience financial difficulties.</p>
<p>
 I can only apologise if this has caused any confusion for students who would have expected the payment date, as normal, to coincide with the date of the start of term.</p>
<p>
 I understand a number of students have been in contact with Money Advice for support.</p>
<p>
 <strong>Zahid Raja, Education Officer said:</strong><br />
 <br />
 I welcome the clarity in the response from the University. However, for many, this administrative error has caused much distress. For those who believe that they have incurred bank charges as a result of the error, it is recommended that you contact Raymond directly: <a href="mailto:Raymond.Ciborowski@swansea.ac.uk">Raymond.Ciborowski@swansea.ac.uk</a><br />

	<p>
 Campus Catering’s commitments to serving fresh and healthy meals have been recognised in the shape of a bronze Food for Life Catering Mark, awarded for the high standard of healthy food in Taliesin and the Venue Fulton House.</p>
<p>
 Campus Catering is the first caterer in Swansea and only the 10<sup>th</sup> University in Britain to achieve the Soil Association’s bronze Food for Life Catering Mark.</p>
<p>
 The project has been heavily encouraged by the Students’ Union, who recognises that both students and staff want to know where their food comes from and have the option to eat healthy meals. The Catering Mark is a unique scheme which recognises restaurants and caterers who serve fresh food which is free from controversial additives and better for animal welfare.</p>
<p>
 Charlotte Britton, Welfare Officer for the Students Union said “I’m really pleased that Campus Catering took the SU’s suggestions on board and went for the Soil Association Food for Life Catering Mark. It shows the University and Union’s joint commitment to providing healthy, fresh, seasonal and high-welfare food free from GM ingredients. Obtaining the Bronze award is a fantastic achievement, and we’re only the 10<sup>th</sup> university in the UK to have it, and the 2<sup>nd</sup> in Wales.</p>
<p>
 “The SU looks forward to working with Campus Catering closely in the future, especially during Better Food fortnight in February.”</p>
<p>
 Explaining the importance of the Catering Mark, Rob Sexton, Chief Executive of Soil Association Certification, said "The bronze Catering Mark is an excellent achievement which recognises the vital role that fresh, seasonal meals play in healthy, planet-friendly menus, especially for large-scale catering. It reassures customers that their meals are free from GM ingredients, trans fats and prepared from scratch.”</p>
<p>

 Swansea student Martin Hayes has beaten strong competition to become National Student Champion at the Student Kitesurfing Association Nationals over the weekend.</p>
<p>
 Martin entered the advance category and secured a win in a final that saw some very impressive tricks. Martin said “To become National Champion is an amazing feeling. I was not expecting to do so well”.</p>
<p>
 Seven members of Swansea University kitesurfing club descended on Westward Ho! with a moderate 15---20 Mph winds. Swansea was amongst ten other universities and 115 competitors from across the country.</p>
<p>
 Alex Macadam, Mark Harris and Joel Edwards entered in the intermediate category with a very high standard of riding, a significant achievement for new riders Alex and Mark who have only taken the sport up since coming to university. Joel Edwards had a very good heat but narrowly missed out on the final due to a very high standard.</p>
<p>
 Frances Carey, the only girl to enter from the university, reached the final having spent a lot of her summer training in Fuerteventura.</p>
<p>
 The kitesurfing club would like to thank Kitemare and Flexifoil for their support. To find out more about kitesurfing go to https://www.facebook.com/groups/swanseauniversitykitesurfing/</p>

	<p>
 A giant mural has been revealed on Mumbles Road to raise awareness of the White Ribbon Campaign amongst students and residents in the city. Swansea University and Swansea Metropolitan Students’ Unions have teamed up with Sink Swansea artists to help publicise the campaign’s call for an end to violence against women.</p>
<p>
 The brightly coloured mural, depicting the image of a heron clutching a white ribbon, has been drawn on the graffiti wall on the Recreation Ground in Brynmill and has been carefully designed by artist Dave Long to represent the ideals behind the White Ribbon Campaign. Long said he believes “the image has the ability to stop local residents in their tracks”.</p>
<p>
 Joint campaign organiser Becki Warrillow, Women’s Officer at Swansea University Students’ Union hopes the mural will “influence passersby and make people think about the effects of domestic violence.”</p>
<p>
 This is the first campaign Swansea University and Swansea Metropolitan Students’ Unions have run together and Michael Twitchen, Welfare and Student Rights Officer at Swansea Met has welcomed the idea, saying “My initial thoughts were that the campaign was for women about women.</p>
<p>
 “I was wrong, it about more than raising awareness, it’s about making a stand to working towards elimination of violence against Women, men and same sex partners. Both our Students’ Union can offer trusted support and sign posting for those who are in need.”</p>
<p>
 The White Ribbon campaign was started by a group of men in Canada who felt they had a responsibility to speak out to end violence against women. The white ribbon is now worn by people across the globe to support the cause.</p>

 Swansea students have voted to take part in the national demo and voice their concerns to the Government, so join Swansea SU as we march through the streets of London to protest about, well, everything getting worse!</p>
<p>
 Maybe you’re a first year paying £9k fees, or you’re sick of hearing about the cuts to education in the UK or really worried about getting a job after your degree. If you're unhappy help us educate the public on what needs changing.<br />
 <br />
 As places are limited to 40, it’s a strictly first come, first serve basis. If you apply and there aren’t any spaces left – don’t worry. We will be creating a guide to help you get down there on your own steam.</p>
<p>
 We will be leaving Fulton House at 6am, and will be leaving London at 5.30pm.</p>

<p>
  Liam Burns, NUS President said, “You’ve got a lot to be angry about. You’ve had your education systematically attacked across the board by the coalition. And even if you get to the other end, what have you got to look forward to?</p>
<p>
 “Youth unemployment is at an all-time high, getting on the property ladder is next to impossible and we don’t even have the safety-net of pensions to look forward to any more.<br />
 <br />
 “In a year in which there are no votes in parliament and no legislation coming before politicians, it’s about time we started setting the agenda.”<br />

 If we don’t demand that politicians listen to us we’ll be ignored, so see you in London on Wednesday 21 November 2012 for #demo2012!”</p>

  Charlotte Britton, Welfare Officer extended her thanks to Dr Simon Hoffman from the Swansea UCU branch, “Massive thanks to Swansea UCU who have funded our coach and the lunches. Without them, we could not afford to go, and we are all bowled over by their generosity.”</p>

			<p class="leader">The Students’ Union is celebrating success over increased careers services</p>
             
            

			<div id="ctl00_ctl17_rptNews_ctl19_pnlArticleText" class="msl_newsbodytext">
	<p>
 The Students’ Union has been successful in its efforts to lobby the University for more staff provision in careers advice.</p>
<p>
 The Union has been lobbying hard to increase the resources underpinning the help final year students receive in getting a job or onto further learning.</p>
<p>
 The careers service had the equivalence of three and a half staff members serving the needs of 15,000 students, so the new members of staff will be very important additions. Two new placement officers will be hired as well as two new administrative assistants to help relieve the burden of work.</p>
<p>
 Mr Raymond Ciborowski, Registrar and Chief Operating Officer for the University confirmed in a statement to the Education Officer that budget provision has been made for the expansion</p>
<p>
 He said "I hope that this latest investment signals the importance we attach to improving the employability prospects that our students will have on graduation.”</p>
<p>
 The Students' Union Education officer, Zahid Raja welcomed the changes saying, “This is fantastic news which again demonstrates how seriously the University considers our concerns when it comes to employability.</p>
<p>
 "However, whilst we celebrate this success, we must all still recognise that there is a great deal of work to be done in increasing the employability of our students.”</p>
<p>
 The Students' Union has been working in partnership with the Employability Academy to help improve services offered and to ensure students leave university with greater employability prospects.</p>
<p>
 Pro Vice Chancellor Professor Hilary Lappin-Scott who is leading the Swansea Employability Academy<strong> </strong>said “Improving the employability of our students is a key priority for the University. The Employability Academy is working strategically to engineer some fantastic opportunities that students can get involved with this year."</p>
<p>
 More information on these services can be found on the Union Education and Employability pages of the website.</p>

			<h5>You may be eligible for a refund on your TV&nbsp;License</h5>

	<p>
 As students in Swansea University prepare for their exams, TV Licensing is reminding those moving home for the summer they might be able to claim a refund on their TV Licence, worth £36.37.</p>
<p>
 To be eligible, students need to have a TV Licence, be leaving their halls or rented accommodation in Swansea and moving back home to a licensed address.</p>
<p>
 Any finance-savvy student who purchased a TV Licence at the start of the academic year will have a full three months remaining on their licence. This means they can now claim a refund for the final unused quarter. The savings could pay for a ticket to a gig, a one-way flight to Amsterdam or night out to celebrate the end of student exams. </p>
<p>
 Sara Jones, spokesperson for TV Licensing in Wales, said:</p>
<p>
 “With exams fast approaching and the Easter term coming to an end, the student refund is fantastic news for students who planned ahead and bought their licence at the start of the academic year. It’s vital students understand the law when it comes to watching or streaming live TV or they risk prosecution and fine of up to £1,000.”</p>
<p>
 Recent research* by TV Licensing shows three out of five students watch at least an hour of TV a day, and 71 per cent of students use their laptop to watch TV. A TV Licence is needed to watch, record or stream programmes at the same time as they are shown on TV. This is the case whether you use a TV, laptop, games console, tablet, mobile phone, or any other device.</p>
<p>
 Phil Davis, Chair of the National Association of Student Money Advisers (NASMA), added:</p>
<p>
 “The summer is a great opportunity for students to repair their bank balances, and it’s important they use every opportunity to do so. Getting a refund on the unused three months of a TV Licence is a really easy step to take.  </p>
<p>
 “It’s important students buy a TV licence at the earliest opportunity when starting university and take advantage of the flexible payment options available to them. Most of all, it’s vital students avoid fines for not holding a  TV Licence – a quick visit to <a href="http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/studentinfo">www.tvlicensing.co.uk/studentinfo</a> helps students ensure they are covered to watch TV on a range of devices.”</p>
<p>
 To arrange a refund, or for further information, simply visit: <a href="http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/studentinfo">www.tvlicensing.co.uk/studentinfo</a>, or call TV Licensing on 0300 790 6090.</p>
